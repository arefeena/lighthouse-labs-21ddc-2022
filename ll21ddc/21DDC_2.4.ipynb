    "### **Day 11: *Advanced Group By Uses in Pandas***\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a break from looking at property prices, Dot went outside to enjoy a classic Emirati breakfast. At a quaint restaurant, they had a delicious plate of shakshuka, or poached eggs with tomatoes, olive oil, onion, and garlic, and a side of khameer bread, a soft, sweet loaf with dates, fennel, saffron, and cardamom. Getting up from their chair with a full belly and a feeling of satisfaction, Dot summoned a taxi and directed the driver to take them over to Dubai Mall, the second-largest mall in the world! \n",
    "\n",
    "The car pulled up to a massive complex, several stories tall and stretching across for miles, with the look of many different buildings mashed up together, surrounded by a large, glimmering pool of water with a fountain. Inside, Dot looked around in wonder at the several levels of stores that seemingly went on for eternity. It was like an enclosed city in itself, with different neighbourhoods of different types of stores and amenities. Dot journeyed over to the large indoor aquarium and spent most of the day staring happily at the manta rays, sharks, and fish. They successfully avoided spending too much money – after all, they needed to save considering the cost of the trip itself. Dot returned to the hotel with an even warmer feeling about Dubai at the end of a happy day. “I could get used to living here,” they said. “Let me look at these property prices again…” Can you help Dot figure out more information about property prices in Dubai?
