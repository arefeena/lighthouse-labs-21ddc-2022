    "The chilly wetness of the west coastâ€™s winter had descended upon Vancouver, and Dot wasnâ€™t too happy about it. The rain pattered down on the cityâ€™s streets all day long, the dark rainclouds obscuring the beautiful view of the Pacific coastline that Dot loved so much. Staring out the window from the home they remotely worked from, Dot began to think that it was time to take a trip. Dot had been saving up their vacation time at work â€” everything lined up perfectly. They even had a friend who would be eager to watch over their pet snake, Python. The more they thought about it, the more appealing the idea seemed. It was time for Dot to take a courageous leap and go internationalâ€¦to Europe and beyond!\n",
    "\n",
    "Dot opened a browser on their laptop and started looking into flights. Their savings account wasnâ€™t bottomless, and the trip would be expensive, so they had to make sure to do things efficiently. Plus, the intercontinental flight would be very long, and Dot got restless on planes â€” they wanted to book a flight that would give them the best value per hour of flight duration. Dot wanted to fly to Europe from the Canadian city that would give them the best combination of value/duration. Dot could manually browse through all the available flights to compare them, but they knew there was a better way to do things â€” we can use data skills to map out the flights for them and decide from which city they should fly out. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Python programming language is built on structures called variables. Put simply, variables are structures that store values within them. A variable can come in many different forms, including strings, integers, and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_a = 'This is a string.'\n",
    "\n",
    "var_b = 2022\n",

    "\n",
    "var_d = ['This','is','a','list','on', 'the',21,'day data challenge.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In the example above, *var_a* is a **string**, and *var_d* is a **list**. Weâ€™ll cover strings and lists in later challenges, but for now letâ€™s focus on numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Numbers in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main numeric data types in Python: **integers** and **float**, or floating point numbers (`var_b` and `var_c` above respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer data type refers to **whole numbers**, while float data type refers to any numeric value that isn't a whole, like a **fraction or a decimal**. You can identify whether something is an integer or a float by looking for a decimal point: integers wonâ€™t have one, but floats will. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python as well as any other programming language, there are a variety of math operations you can use to do basic arithmetic. \n",
